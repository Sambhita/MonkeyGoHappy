        <br> I made a website for myself. I hope I will make many changes in future.

<b style = "font-size: 200%; color: white ; font-family: 'Papyrus'"> <i>The Changes are :-
    <br>(Part 1)
    <ol>
    <li> I created a background. </li>
    <li> I wrote a sentence and change its colour, font, size and underlined the headings and even add an emoji.</li>
    <li> And all of these I somehow managed to code in html with notpad.</li>
    </ol><br> (Part 2)
    <ol>
    <li> In part 2 I tranfer the code form notpad to my personal favourite software (Visual Studio), and I am pretty sure that I will carry on making changes in Visual Studio. </li>
    <li> I made a transparent background and I want to show my text on that background just to make a kind of, professional look and I did that.</li>
    <li> I add light shadow to make it satisfying.</li>
</ol>
    <br> To Be Continued.....
